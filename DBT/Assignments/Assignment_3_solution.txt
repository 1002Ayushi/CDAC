

1) Yes, ANSI SQL recognizes the data type DATE. The DATE type is used to store date values (year, month, and day) in a format that allows for easy manipulation and querying.

Key Points about the DATE Data Type:

Format: 
Typically, a DATE is stored in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
Range:
 The DATE type can represent dates ranging from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'.
Functions:
 ANSI SQL provides various functions to work with dates, such as adding or subtracting days, extracting parts of the date (like year or month), and comparing dates.
Different SQL database systems may have their own implementations and additional features related to the DATE type, but the ANSI SQL standard provides a consistent foundation
